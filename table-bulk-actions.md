# Table Bulk Actions

The Table component supports performing Bulk Actions. First, you must register a supporting route using the `spladeTable()` method on the `Route` facade. As of version 0.6, the automatic installer does this for you. If you need to register the route manually, make sure it uses the `web` and `splade` Middleware, for example, in `web.php`:

```php
Route::middleware('splade')->group(function () {
    Route::spladeTable();
});
```

## Configure a Bulk Action

You may configure a Bulk Action on the `SpladeTable` instance:

```php
public function configure(SpladeTable $table)
{
    $table->bulkAction('Touch timestamp', function (Project $project) {
        $project->touch();
    });
}
```

The `bulkAction` method has additional `before` and `after` arguments. You may use this to show a [Toast](/toasts.md) when the action has finished, or for example, to perform some logging:

```php
$table->bulkAction(
    label: 'Touch timestamp',
    each: fn (Project $project) => $project->touch(),
    before: fn () => info('Touching the selected projects'),
    after: fn () => Toast::info('Timestamps updated!')
);
```

The `before` and `after` callbacks receive the selected rows as an argument. You may use this to perform additional actions, for example, to send an email to the selected users:

```php
$table->bulkAction(
    label: 'Notify users',
    before: function (array $selectedIds) {
        $users = User::whereIn('id', $selectedIds)->get();

        Mail::to($users)->send(new ImportantNotification);
    }
);
```

Note that when all rows are selected, the callbacks receive an array with a single `*` item:

```php
function (array $selectedIds) {
    $users = User::query()
        ->unless($selectedIds === ['*'], fn ($query) => $query->whereIn('id', $selectedIds))
        ->get();

    Mail::to($users)->send(new ImportantNotification);
}
```

## Confirmation

You may use the `confirm` argument to show a confirmation dialog before Splade performs the action:

```php
$table->bulkAction(
    label: 'Touch timestamp',
    each: fn (Project $project) => $project->touch(),
    confirm: true
);
```

In addition, you may customize the confirmation dialog:

```php
$table->bulkAction(
    label: 'Touch timestamp',
    each: fn (Project $project) => $project->touch(),
    confirm: 'Touch projects',
    confirmText: 'Are you sure you want to touch the projects?',
    confirmButton: 'Yes, touch all selected rows!',
    cancelButton: 'No, do not touch!',
);
```

### Password Confirmation

It's even possible to require the user to confirm their password within the confirmation dialog. First, you must register a supporting route using the `spladePasswordConfirmation()` method on the `Route` facade. As of version 1.2.2, the automatic installer does this for you. If you need to register the route manually, make sure it uses the `web` Middleware, for example, in `web.php`:

```php
Route::spladePasswordConfirmation();
```

Now you may set the `requirePassword` argument to `true`:

```php
$table->bulkAction(
    label: 'Delete projects',
    each: fn (Project $project) => $project->delete(),
    confirm: true,
    requirePassword: true
);
```

## Authorization

Just like [Form Requests](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/validation#authorizing-form-requests), you may use the `authorize` method to determine if the user has the authority to perform a Bulk Action:

```php
class Projects extends AbstractTable
{
    public function authorize(Request $request)
    {
        return $request->user()->is_admin;
    }
}
```
